# Rocket Pub Portal

**Overview**

A Rocket HTTP server hosting HTML and static files for SSB pubs.

**Rationale**

I wanted to run a simple webpage for my SSB pub (@pub.solarpunk.network) and decided Rust / Rocket would be a good option. Right now the HTML only displays a background image. I'll eventually add contact information for requesting invite codes.
